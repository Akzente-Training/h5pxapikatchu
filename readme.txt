This Wordpress plugin is a simple solution to catch 'em all, those xAPI statements that have been sent by H5P content types. Users should be able to filter, store and view/export the xAPI statements.

== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin is a simple solution to catch 'em all, those xAPI statements that have been sent by H5P (https://h5p.org) content types. Users should be able to store and view/export the xAPI statements.

This plugin is NOT intended to provide functionality for analysis, etc. There is no point in recreating what is already available in Learning Record Stores or what you can do yourself with a spreadsheet software, scikit-learn, etc.

If you need more, you should give Learning Locker (https://learninglocker.net/) a shot. It's open, free and shiny.

== Installation ==

Install H5PxAPIkatchu from the Wordpress Plugin directory or via your Wordpress instance and activate it. Done.

The most important parts  of the xAPI statements that are emitted by H5P content types on your system should now be stored in your database. You can view and download them via the new WordPress menu item.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
