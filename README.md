# H5PxAPIkatchu
This Wordpress plugin is intended to become a simple solution to catch 'em all,
those xAPI statements that have been sent by [H5P](https://h5p.org) content types. Users should be
able to filter, store and view/export the xAPI statements.

No, it is not intended to provide funtionality for analytics, etc. There is no point in recreating what is already available in Learning Record Stores. I am just planning to offer a halfway decent option for storing the xAPI results. If you need more, you should give [Learning Locker](https://learninglocker.net/) a shot. It's [open](https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker), free and shiny.
