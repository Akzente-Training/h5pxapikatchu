# H5PxAPIkatchu
This Wordpress plugin is intended to become a simple solution to catch 'em all,
those xAPI statements that have been sent by H5P content types. Users should be
able to filter, store and view/export the xAPI statements.

No, it is not intended to provide funtionality for analytics, etc. There is no point in recreating what is already available in Learning Record Stores. I am just planning to offer a halfway decent option for storing the xAPI results.
